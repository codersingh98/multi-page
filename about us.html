    <p>When Milk Jar was born in founder Holly Singer’s kitchen in November, 2016, it answered two of her desires: to bring clean-burning, beautifully smelling candles to the local market, and to be a vehicle for giving back. Years prior, while studying Kinesiology in University, Holly developed a close friendship with a boy with Cerebral Palsy and his mother. Forever struck by the resilience of people with disabilities and the barriers they face, it was Holly's goal to raise $500 in Milk Jar’s 
        first year for programs that support learning and growth. Little did she know, Milk Jar would grow to make a far, far greater impact than she ever could have imagined.
